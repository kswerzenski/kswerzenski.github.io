## Forecasting the Future of Extreme Weather Events

### About
It seems like every time you flip on the news these days, there are reports of major weather events leveling homes, destroying businesses, and ravaging entire communities. Hurricanes, floods, wildfires, tornadoes, and more seem to occur with increasing frequency and intensity, leaving behind devastating impacts in their wakes. In fact, in 2023, the United States experienced a record of 28 distinct extreme weather events that each cost over one billion dollars in damages, surpassing the previous record of 22 set in 2020 (Smith, 2024). 

The growing intensity and frequency of these events have largely been attributed to climate change, with research attributing rising global temperatures to exacerbating weather patterns and contributing to more severe storms and longer droughts, increasing the likelihood of more extreme and unpredictable weather phenomena (IPCC, 2021), In addition, these extreme weather events often hit the most vulnerable populations the hardest, underscoring the need for strategic adaptation and disaster response plans to mitigate the damage (Joseph & Doon, 2023). These economic and social impacts of extreme weather events extend beyond the immediate destruction they cause, and as communities struggle to recover and rebuild, we often see even more long-term consequences for public health, local economies, and the environment come to light.

Understanding the trends and patterns of extreme weather events over time is critical to informing better preparedness, response strategies, and long-term policy decisions. Accurate data on the frequency, severity, and types of weather events is essential for developing more effective risk management frameworks that prioritize resilience and adaptation. This project explores the role of data analytics in understanding the evolving nature of extreme weather events, with a focus on how such analysis can inform policies aimed at reducing risk and building more resilient communities in this rapidly changing world.

### Data
Data was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) storm events database for the years 2004-2024. This database contains records of extreme weather events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and more across the United States, and includes data such as event types, locations, dates, severity metrics, and human (fatalities, injuries) and economic (damage cost) impacts.
