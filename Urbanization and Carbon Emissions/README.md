# Understanding the Relationships of Urbanization and Carbon Emissions

## Introduction

Since the 1950s, the number of people living in urban areas has exploded from 751 million to over 4.2 billion. This number is only anticipated to increase, with the United Nations projecting an additional 2.1 billion people moving to urban centers by 2050 (United Nations, 2018). This rapid shift toward urban living presents both opportunities and challenges. As more people migrate to urban areas, cities are becoming hubs of economic activity, which in turn drives up demand for energy, transportation, and industrial production. This surge in urban population growth will also be accompanied by an increase in construction, infrastructure development, and vehicle usage, all of which contribute to greater energy consumption and, consequently, greater environmental impacts.

One of the most significant environmental concerns related to urbanization is the impact on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Urban areas are responsible for a large portion of global CO2 emissions, with cities accounting for close to 70% of global CO2 emissions associated with energy consumption, even reaching proportions as high as 80% In North America (depending on the definition of emissions scope and urban boundaries) (Luqman et al., 2023). However, urbanization also presents an opportunity for more sustainable practices. Denser population centers allow for more efficient use of resources, such as energy and land, and can foster the development of public transportation systems, green infrastructure, and renewable energy solutions (Ritcher et al., 2024). When managed effectively, cities have the potential to reduce per capita CO2 emissions compared to more sparsely populated areas, primarily through improved infrastructure and more sustainable practices. As urban growth continues, understanding the factors driving CO2 emissions in cities is essential for developing policies and infrastructure that can mitigate these impacts and promote more sustainable urbanization.

This research addresses the core question of how urbanization influences CO2 emissions at the national level. More granularly, it seeks to identify the key drivers of CO2 emissions that are associated with urbanization, such as population density, energy consumption, and infrastructure development, and to assess the extent to which these factors contribute to emissions. Additionally, through clustering countries with similar urbanization patterns, this study also aims to provide actionable insights that can inform policy recommendations for cities – particularly those in developing regions – on how to urbanize sustainably and reduce their environmental footprint. By identifying the factors that most strongly correlate with CO2 emissions, this research will provide actionable insights that can guide policies aimed at minimizing the environmental impact of urban growth and supporting the transition to more sustainable cities.
