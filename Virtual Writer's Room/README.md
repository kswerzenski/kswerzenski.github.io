# Virtual Writer's Room: A Gen-AI Powered Focus Group for Screenwriters

## About
The use of generative AI in creative fields has been a hotly debated topic. Because some of generative AI's earliest applications were designed to mimic creative work – like storytelling, art, and music composition – it is no surprise that creative fields were among the first to grapple with its potential impact. This technology even became a major point of contention during last year’s Hollywood actors' and writers' strikes, fueling debates about its implications for job security, intellectual property rights, and the preservation of human creativity (Scherer, 2024). However, while much of the conversation in this space has been focused on the risks that generative AI poses to human creativity, I think there is a conversation worth having on the other side as well exploring the opportunities that this technology could hold for individuals in creative fields.

As a freelance writer and graphic designer myself, I know that this industry is truly a labor of love, deeply rooted in human experience, intuition, and emotion – qualities that machines, no matter how well trained, cannot fully replicate. I was even strongly against the use of generative AI for most tasks when some of the more public interfaces began hitting the mainstream market in fear of the people and professions it could easily displace. However, as I begin to learn more about how generative AI works, I believe that does hold potential to act as a powerful ally for creatives, enabling them to supercharge their work rather than replace it. One particular area of interest for me is in how it can improve storytelling.

One of the biggest challenges I often face as a writer is gathering feedback in a timely manner to whatever it may be that I am writing. In doing some research on if generative AI has been leveraged in this space, I came across WritingGroupAI that serves almost like a virtual writer’s circle, providing instant feedback and ideas to writers. I wondered if this tuning of these large language models to aid writers in the writing process could be taken a step further into specializing specifically in film and television show scripts and pitches. There is a lot of documentation out there of generative AI models being fine tuned to serve as focus groups of sorts (Oberoi, 2024), so my idea is to fine tune a generative AI model to serve as a focus group for film and television writers to get instant feedback from a desired audience of their stories and scripts. This tool would allow writers to test their ideas with virtual audience profiles, offering immediate insights into how specific demographics might react to their characters, plots, or themes. By simulating a diverse range of audience perspectives, this AI-powered focus group could help writers refine their stories in real time, bridging the gap between creators and viewers while enhancing the storytelling process.

My main goal for this project is to fine tune a large language model to serve as a virtual focus group, providing real-time feedback on film and TV scripts to both seasoned and aspiring screenwriters. Through simulating different audiences, this AI tool will help creators identify potential narrative issues early in the development process, ensuring that their work resonates more deeply with diverse demographics. The aim is not to replace human input but to enhance the creative process, making it more efficient and targeted while empowering writers to make informed decisions based on insights that are typically gathered only after test screenings or focus groups. My hope would also be that this tool could save writers time that they can spend focusing on what truly matters – their craft. By providing instant, actionable feedback, this tool would allow writers to refine their work more quickly and confidently, allowing them to stay at the forefront of such a high-speed industry. 

This tool would not only streamline the development process but also give writers more creative freedom to experiment and refine their stories without the delays and limitations of traditional feedback methods. Ultimately, the goal is to support the writer’s vision while giving them the tools to ensure their work connects with audiences in a meaningful way.
