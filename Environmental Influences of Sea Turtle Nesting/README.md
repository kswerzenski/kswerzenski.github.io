# Modeling Environmental Influences of Sea Turtle Nesting Behaviors

## Introduction
In 2023, sea turtles along Florida’s coastlines nested at unprecedented rates, with loggerhead sea turtles surpassing their previous record by over 30,000 nests and green sea turtles by over 20,000 nests (Kruger, 2023). Being that almost every mile of Florida’s coastline is surveyed by scientists and volunteers to document all sea turtle nesting activity and collect valuable data on the nesting population of these endangered and threatened species, this led to extremely long days of fieldwork in borderline dangerous environments and increased strain on the resources of conservation organizations across the state. As the numbers continued to tick up and the field days became longer, everyone across the state had just one question: could we have seen this coming?

Currently, sea turtle conservation programs rely on retrospective data collection rather than predictive insights. Survey teams hit the beaches at sunrise to document every nest and false crawl, recording data that is essential for long-term monitoring but does little to prepare conservationists for the season ahead. A sudden surge in nesting activity, like the one observed in 2023, stretches resources thin, leading to exhaustion among field teams and logistical challenges in ensuring data accuracy, maintaining consistency in survey efforts, and preventing gaps that could compromise long-term monitoring and research. If patterns in nesting activity could be anticipated in advance, conservation organizations could allocate resources more efficiently, ensuring proper coverage of critical nesting areas while reducing the burden on survey teams.

Additionally, understanding the factors that drive fluctuations in nesting activity is key to improving long-term conservation strategies. While researchers have long speculated that environmental conditions such as temperature, tides, and lunar cycles may influence nesting behavior, there has been limited research on predictive modeling in this area. One study used ARIMA models and regression techniques to examine the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) on loggerhead nesting activity in Zakynthos, Greece, finding that incorporating SST data improved forecasting accuracy (Mazaris et al 2004). However, few other studies have attempted to develop comprehensive models that integrate multiple environmental factors to predict nesting activity across different regions. Developing a predictive model could provide valuable insights into when and where high nesting activity is likely to occur, helping conservationists optimize their efforts, adjust staffing needs, and implement proactive management strategies.
