    "In this milestone, I will be experimenting with a couple of different prompts to test the feasibility of using a large language model to serve as a virtual focus group for aspiring screenwriters to gain real-time feedback on their stories, characters, and overall narrative structure. To do this, I am going to test a couple of different prompts to see where the strengths and weaknesses of the model lie. These prompts will use a mix of both non-copyrighted script samples that have been gathered from an online acting class \"StageMilk\" as well as overall story synopses for made-up films and television shows. Because of ethical and potential legal complications of using real copyrighted scripts, I chose to only experiment with fake or educational scripts at this stage until I have been able to ensure I can create this kind of project in a responsible way due to the sensitivities of using generative AI in creative fields such as this.\n",

The model's suggestion to explore some of the artist's journey to become an artist would certainly lend well to this kind of short film, potentially making the impact of the resolution even more impactful to see the artist's journey from beginning to end. On the pacing front, the model's suggsetion to have plenty of examples of the artist's struggle and frustration with not finding inspiration is also sound advice to really set the story up to have a great emotional impact when the resolution came.

    "Overall, the model was able to pull out some of the major themes of this short script, such as friendship and communication. Similar to some of the prompts above, it did provide some good general ideas of how to strengthen the script around these themes, such as exploring the idea of how pets can be usde as a way that we present ourselves to others which could lead to some interesting story angles. Again, the model suggests a mix of both good and not so good ideas, but still provides a starting point for the writer to refine and build upon. "

    "After going through these prompt experiments, I am farily confident in the feasibility of being able to tune a model to serve as a virtual focus group for aspiring screenwriters. The model demonstrated its ability to provide generalized feedback, highlighting key themes and offering broad suggestions for improvement. However, to truly make this tool impactful, fine-tuning will be essential, enabling the model to better understand nuanced elements like character development, pacing, and dialogue tailored to target demographics to provide more specific and specilized feedback to writers. This enhancement would make the feedback more relevant and actionable, offering writers a more sophisticated resource to refine their work. Overall, these experiments have shown that with the right adjustments, a generative AI model could become a valuable asset in the creative process, helping writers craft compelling narratives that resonate with their intended audiences (and, as a byproduct of these experiments, I think writers are safe to say that AI won't be outright taking their jobs anytime soon)."
