# The Rising Cost of Childcare Costs in Florida - Data Storytelling

## About
The increasing cost of childcare has emerged as one of the most pressing financial challenges that families today face. With prices rising faster than wages in many regions, it is important now more than ever to understand the underlying factors that could be influencing these costs. Using the National Database of Childcare Prices, I set out to analyze the landscape of center-based childcare costs in Florida compared to median household incomes in an effort to explore how childcare costs have changed over time and how they impact families at both the state and county levels. This project focuses on storytelling with data using a variety of different mediums, including infographics, blog posts, and interractive dashboards.
