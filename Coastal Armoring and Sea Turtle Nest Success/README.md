# The Impacts of Coastal Armoring on Sea Turtle Nest Success

## About
Climate change is becoming an increasing threat to coastal communities. Between rising ocean temperatures and levels, as well as increasing frequency and intensity of catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes, there has been an increased interest in these coastal communities to find ways to more effectively to protect coastlines and attempt to prevent substantial property losses when extreme weather events do occur. In Florida, one of the most popular forms of this coastal armoring are vertical seawalls which replace natural dunes with a hard structure to absorb impacts of wave action and resist storm surge. While these seawalls have been seen to be effective in protecting infrastructure there is increasing evidence that they accelerate erosion and will ultimately lead to more rapidly deteriorating coastlines. In addition, their effects on coastal and beach ecosystems are not well studied and understood, and being that Florida beaches serve as some of the most important nesting habitat in the world for endangered species of sea turtles, it is imperative that we understand how these structures are interacting with these ecosystems and impacting the plants and animals that depend on it.

This project sets out to answer the question of how the presence of hard coastal armoring, such as vertical seawalls, affects sea turtle nest success.
